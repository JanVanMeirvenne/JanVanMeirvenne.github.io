Recently I got the question if the machine used to log a request or incident through the SCSM portal could be used in an automated runbook. The catch was: both end-user input or the SCCM primary user feature was not possible.

After some looking around and tinkering I got a decent alternative, which you can find [here](http://www.jvm-net.com/?p=1443).
