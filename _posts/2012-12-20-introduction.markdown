Hi

My name is Jan Van Meirvenne and I am a System Center consultant employed by [Ferranti Computer Systems](http://www.ferranti.be/en/node/122).
My main focus area is Operations Manager, but I alsoÂ touch Orchestrator and Configuration Manager from time to time.

With this blog I hope to share my experiences, knowledge and insights regarding my work with the community.

I already have a blog [here](http://www.jvm-net.com), and I will keep posting there aswell as here.

I hope you learn something new everyday you ready any SCUG blogpost, happy reading!
