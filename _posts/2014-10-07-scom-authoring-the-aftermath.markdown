For the people who attended my SCOM authoring session, thanks once again for your attention. While it was quite an advanced topic I hope it shed some light on how SCOM functions and how it can be optimized regarding creating and maintaining monitoring definitions.

 

My slide deck can be found here: [http://www.slideshare.net/JanVanMeirvenne/scom-authoring](http://www.slideshare.net/JanVanMeirvenne/scom-authoring)

 

My demo project can be found here: [http://1drv.ms/1t0OPIG](http://1drv.ms/1t0OPIG)

 

Please note that Microsoft [announced](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn806370.aspx) the retirement of the Visio authoring method for SCOM. Although it is a useful tool especially with designing management packs alongside with customers, I guess it was a bit too much of an odd bird with many limitations. The recommendation is to use MPAuthor or the Visual Studio addin (links included in the wiki link below).
